## Description
Proof of concept app for Part 21 DOA engineering. Written in python (Tkinter).
Not currently being worked on and not fully tested. Making this public on the off chance someone is interested.

Intention of the app is improve productivity on typcial Part 21 tasks (LOPS/PSUs/EELs).
App allows the use to define parts and generate the various layouts.
Generated layouts can be exported to dxf CAD files, MS Word/Excel tables.

For EELs the user can define a current layout and a go-to layout. A final layout to be installed on the aircraft (choosing which existing items to keep) can be defined and a BOM generated accordingly.

The intention was to include a database system, where details of parts could be stored for future reference. As an example, weight, documenation and attaching hardware for a piece of emergency equipment could be stored in a database, and be quickly obtainable for future projects. This was never implemented.

## Features
  - Add seats
  - Create LOPAs
  - Automatically generate PSU layouts
  - Add emergency equipment
  - Generate EEL layouts (current and go-to)

## Limitations
  - Only tested on windows 10
  - A320 only
